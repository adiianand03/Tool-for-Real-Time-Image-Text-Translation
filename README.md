# Real-time-text-detection-and-translation

A Streamlit Application developed by us for Real Time text translation from Video. It functions in the following manner: first it captures images using Camera and extracts image from the Real time video and save it in a folder. The image is uploaded to the server and text is extracted further the same text is translated using the Google Transalte API.
